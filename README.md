# MYROUND
## Introduction
MYROUND is a tracking web application that allows users to record their scores for each round of golf (18 holes).
Users can input their scores and round details to track the score, the golf course, date, feeling, and some notes about each round like a diary.
Users can also delete and edit their rounds on the web application.
